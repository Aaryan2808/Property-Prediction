# Property-Prediction
Step1) Cleaning the dataset, i.e removing the NA values
Step2) Feature Extraction:- transformed the data into features which can be used to create a predictive model, example changing price to price per squarefeet
step3) Dimensionality Reduction
step4) Outlier Detection and Removal
step5) Finding the best model using GridSearchCV(Linear Regression, Lasso, Decision Tree Regressor)
step6) Exporting the Model using Pickle
